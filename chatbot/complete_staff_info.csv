Rob van Nieuwpoort,Professor Efficient Computing and eScience,r.v.van.nieuwpoort@liacs.leidenuniv.nl,,Gorlaeus Building Einsteinweg 55 2333 CC Leiden Room number BW3.06,,,"Rob van Nieuwpoort ’s research involves ways in which large-scale computing power can be used more efficiently in achieving scientific breakthroughs in various scientific fields. Over the past few decades, computers have changed fundamentally, and a shift has taken place in the balance between computing power and data transport. Computer processing speeds are increasing, but computers can’t feed the relevant data into the processors quickly enough. In addition, computers have become highly parallel: they carry out a lot of calculations simultaneously. Many scientific applications have been unable to keep up with these developments. As a result, much scientific software remains sub-optimal. Improving this software will result in faster large-scale data processing and enhanced scientific tools such as telescopes, climate simulations, particle accelerators, etc. He develops new programming models that make the use of large-scale systems (so-called exascale computers) simpler and more efficient. In addition, energy efficiency also plays a crucial part. For large-scale scientific experiments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope , energy use is a limiting factor and a major expense. In these cases, software that uses energy more efficiently will have the immediate effect of increasing the sensitivity of the instruments. His second research interest is eScience. The field of eScience promotes the use of digital technology in research. eScience brings together IT technology, data science, computational science, e-infrastructure and data- and computation-intensive research across all disciplines, from physics to the humanities. He works on bridging fundamental computer science research and its application in exciting scientific disciplines.",

Funding: NWO 2017-2027 Quantum Annealing Optimization Algorithms People: Sheir Yarkoni, Florian Neukart, Thomas Bäck, Aske Plaat Industry-relevant optimization problems may have many different forms, for example: continuous, stochastic, high-dimensional, and more. However, commercial quantum annealers can currently only solve QUBO problems, so problems need to be posed to the annealer in this form. Since finding an optimal transformation to QUBO is an NP-hard problem in itself, discovering efficient ways of generating QUBO forms for generic optimization problems is the first step in this research. We will also study Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Annealing.

Henning Basold,Assistant professor,h.basold@liacs.leidenuniv.nl,+31 71 527 6435,Gorlaeus Building Einsteinweg 55 2333 CC Leiden Room number BM2.11,,,"Some keywords that appear in Henning's research: Logic, category theory, coalgebra and coinduction, proof theory, type theory, programming languages, semantics, and computational models, concurrency, formally verified mathematics and programming, proof assistants, proofs-as-programs/Curry-Howard/Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation, (co)homological algebra, mathematical biology. Systems are an assemblage of objects or components that are interrelated. This concept occurs throughout computer science, mathematics, biology, physics and many other fields. Concrete examples of systems that Henning studies are computational models like automata, concurrent processes and probabilistic processes, control and reactive systems, combinatorics and recurrence relations, dynamical systems, systems of interacting agents, and biological systems. The main mathematical tools that he uses are coalgebras, coinduction, category theory, logic and type theory, with a particular focus on computer-verifiable correctness of proofs and programs. Henning's research interest descend from the general desire to prevent errors in software, hardware, and mathematical or other theories, and to understand relations between different scientific fields. The approach chosen by Henning is the formalisation of artefacts, like software or theories, in terms of a syntactic logic, as a program, in a type theory or any other suitable syntactic language. A formal syntactic specification will allow then a computer to verify the correctness of behaviour and proofs. Leaving the creative work of building programs, models and proofs to humans and the mechanical work of verifying them to computers ensures not only correctness of artefacts and scales to arbitrary sizes, but it also frees us a from worries and allows us to focus on the interesting part of work as a programmer, mathematician, and biologist. Short biography Henning joined the theory group of LIACS mid-2019. Before that, he was a post-doc in the PLUME group of the Laboratoire de l'informatique du parallélisme at the ENS Lyon. He obtained his doctoral degree with the topic ""Mixed Inductive-Coinductive Reasoning"" under the supervision of Herman Geuvers, Helle Hvid Hansen and Jan Rutten at the Radboud University in collaboration with the CWI Amsterdam.

Dr Saunders was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Sydney in 2002 for his work at the Key Centre of Design Computing and Cognition on Curious Design Agents and Artificial Creativity. Dr Saunders’ doctoral dissertation developed computational models of individual, social and cultural creativity and applied these models to Design Computing and Computational Creativity. Prof. Simeon Simoff, Dean of the School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics at the Western Sydney University, pronounced his doctoral dissertation was “nothing less than the definition of a new area of research in design computing”. Dr Saunders’ research has made significant contributions to the fields of Computational Creativity and Design Computing, opening up new areas of research in the computational modelling of intrinsic motivations in creative design systems, the use of multi-agent systems to computationally study social and cultural aspects of creativity, and the embodiment of creative, material processes through the development of creative, social and architectural robotics. In particular, his work on the computational modelling of social creativity has proven to be influential and has recently been included in Readings in Computational Creativity, a collection of canonical papers on the subject. His research has been praised in Ecologies of Invention (University of Sydney Press, 2013: 51) by Professor Dan Lovallo “[Saunders] is breaking new ground on modelling creativity algorithmically…In Saunders’ model, creativity is a function of both an algorithm’s individual evaluations of creativity combined with emergent social definitions of creativity. That is, the robots individually define what is creative based upon their own set of interactions with the environment, and thereby influence emergent social definitions of creativity”. Dr Saunders is internationally recognised as a leader in the Computational Creativity research community. He has held positions on the Steering Committee for the International Conference for Computational Creativity and the Advisory Board for the Association of Computational Creativity.

Systems are an assemblage of objects or components that are interrelated. This concept occurs throughout computer science, mathematics, biology, physics and many other fields. Concrete examples of systems that Henning studies are computational models like automata, concurrent processes and probabilistic processes, control and reactive systems, combinatorics and recurrence relations, dynamical systems, systems of interacting agents, and biological systems. The main mathematical tools that he uses are coalgebras, coinduction, category theory, logic and type theory, with a particular focus on computer-verifiable correctness of proofs and programs. Henning's research interest descend from the general desire to prevent errors in software, hardware, and mathematical or other theories, and to understand relations between different scientific fields. The approach chosen by Henning is the formalisation of artefacts, like software or theories, in terms of a syntactic logic, as a program, in a type theory or any other suitable syntactic language. A formal syntactic specification will allow then a computer to verify the correctness of behaviour and proofs. Leaving the creative work of building programs, models and proofs to humans and the mechanical work of verifying them to computers ensures not only correctness of artefacts and scales to arbitrary sizes, but it also frees us a from worries and allows us to focus on the interesting part of work as a programmer, mathematician, and biologist. Short biography Henning joined the theory group of LIACS mid-2019. Before that, he was a post-doc in the PLUME group of the Laboratoire de l'informatique du parallélisme at the ENS Lyon. He obtained his doctoral degree with the topic ""Mixed Inductive-Coinductive Reasoning"" under the supervision of Herman Geuvers, Helle Hvid Hansen and Jan Rutten at the Radboud University in collaboration with the CWI Amsterdam. The topics of Henning's bachelor and master's degree obtained at the TU Braunschweig were, respectively, elliptic curve cryptography on FPGAs and SMT-based verification of reactive systems written in ANSYS SCADE.",

He is also an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (Canada) , where he holds an additional appointment as Faculty Associate at the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies. He is a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and past president of the Canadian Association for Artificial Intelligence / Association pour l'intelligence artificielle au Canada (CAIAC). Holger completed his PhD in 1998 at TU Darmstadt (Germany), where he previously studied computer science, mathematics and biochemistry. Holger's research interests span artificial intelligence, empirical algorithmics, bioinformatics and computer music. He is known for his work on machine learning and optimisation methods for the automated design of high-performance algorithms and for his work on stochastic local search. Based on a broad view of machine learning, he has developed - and vigorously pursues - the paradigm of programming by optimisation (PbO); he is also one of the originators of the concept of automated machine learning (AutoML). Holger has a penchant for work at the boundaries between computing science and other disciplines, and much of his work is inspired by real-world applications. In 2018, together with Morten Irgens (Oslo Metropolitan University) and Philipp Slusallek (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence), Holger launched CLAIRE , an initiative by the European AI community that seeks to strengthen European excellence in AI research and innovation. CLAIRE promotes excellence across all of AI, for all of Europe, with a human-centred focus and aims to achieve an impact similar to that of CERN. The initiative has attracted major media coverage in many European countries and garnered broad support by more than 1000 AI experts, more than one hundred fellows of various scientific AI associations, many editors of scientific AI journals, national AI societies, top AI institutes and key stakeholders in industry and other organisations (for details, see claire-ai.org ).",

Playfulness Themes that reappear in my research and lecturing are artificial intelligence, robots, hybrid bio-digital systems, and of course playfulness . You may be interested to know that I was selected by Vrij Nederland (2015) as one of the ""most inspiring technologists, inventors and tinkerers in The Netherlands"". Also, I gave a TEDx talk entitled ""Academic Freedom for the Young"" in which I argue that academic playfulness should be a student's right. Bio My formal education focussed mainly on AI.

For this it is important that methods and results are explainable to domain experts, who may not be data scientists. His approach is to define and identify patterns that matter, i.e., succinct descriptions that characterise relevant structure present in the data. Which patterns matter strongly depends on the data and task at hand, hence defining the problem is one of the key challenges. Information theoretic concepts such as the minimum description length (MDL) principle have proven very useful to this end. Matthijs is also interested in interactive data mining, i.e., involving humans in the loop. Finally, he is interested in fundamental data mining research for real-world applications, both in science (e.g., life sciences, social sciences) and industry (e.g., manufacturing and engineering, aviation), as this is the best way to show that the theory works in practice.

Over the past few decades, computers have changed fundamentally, and a shift has taken place in the balance between computing power and data transport. Computer processing speeds are increasing, but computers can’t feed the relevant data into the processors quickly enough. In addition, computers have become highly parallel: they carry out a lot of calculations simultaneously. Many scientific applications have been unable to keep up with these developments. As a result, much scientific software remains sub-optimal. Improving this software will result in faster large-scale data processing and enhanced scientific tools such as telescopes, climate simulations, particle accelerators, etc. He develops new programming models that make the use of large-scale systems (so-called exascale computers) simpler and more efficient. In addition, energy efficiency also plays a crucial part. For large-scale scientific experiments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope , energy use is a limiting factor and a major expense. In these cases, software that uses energy more efficiently will have the immediate effect of increasing the sensitivity of the instruments. His second research interest is eScience. The field of eScience promotes the use of digital technology in research. eScience brings together IT technology, data science, computational science, e-infrastructure and data- and computation-intensive research across all disciplines, from physics to the humanities. He works on bridging fundamental computer science research and its application in exciting scientific disciplines.",

However, commercial quantum annealers can currently only solve QUBO problems, so problems need to be posed to the annealer in this form. Since finding an optimal transformation to QUBO is an NP-hard problem in itself, discovering efficient ways of generating QUBO forms for generic optimization problems is the first step in this research. We will also study Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Annealing.

Dr Saunders was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Sydney in 2002 for his work at the Key Centre of Design Computing and Cognition on Curious Design Agents and Artificial Creativity. Dr Saunders’ doctoral dissertation developed computational models of individual, social and cultural creativity and applied these models to Design Computing and Computational Creativity. Prof. Simeon Simoff, Dean of the School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics at the Western Sydney University, pronounced his doctoral dissertation was “nothing less than the definition of a new area of research in design computing”. Dr Saunders’ research has made significant contributions to the fields of Computational Creativity and Design Computing, opening up new areas of research in the computational modelling of intrinsic motivations in creative design systems, the use of multi-agent systems to computationally study social and cultural aspects of creativity, and the embodiment of creative, material processes through the development of creative, social and architectural robotics. In particular, his work on the computational modelling of social creativity has proven to be influential and has recently been included in Readings in Computational Creativity, a collection of canonical papers on the subject. His research has been praised in Ecologies of Invention (University of Sydney Press, 2013: 51) by Professor Dan Lovallo “[Saunders] is breaking new ground on modelling creativity algorithmically…In Saunders’ model, creativity is a function of both an algorithm’s individual evaluations of creativity combined with emergent social definitions of creativity. That is, the robots individually define what is creative based upon their own set of interactions with the environment, and thereby influence emergent social definitions of creativity”. Dr Saunders is internationally recognised as a leader in the Computational Creativity research community. He has held positions on the Steering Committee for the International Conference for Computational Creativity and the Advisory Board for the Association of Computational Creativity. Dr Saunders is regularly invited to speak on the subject of Computational Creativity and Creative AI to academic, industry and public audiences.",

The central question in most of her work is how cognitive biases interact with cultural evolution mechanisms (i.e., interaction between individuals and transmission across generations) to shape the structures we see in human languages. With her team, she develops novel methods to study emerging communication systems in the lab as well as with computational agents. Most AI language models are trained through exposure to large amounts of data. However, human language evolved in a much more dynamic setting. Using our knowledge of human language evolution, her aim is to improve the human likeness of neural-agent language simulations. Besides developing and running studies in the lab, she designs live exhibits to bring scientific questions, experiments and lectures to museums and festivals (for instance at Lowlands Science and Science Center Nemo). In addition, Tessa actively collaborates with researchers of various other faculties within Leiden University (Social and Behavioral Sciences, Humanities, Law) and other universities (University of Groningen, UC San Diego, UC Merced). Before joining Leiden University, Tessa was a postdoc at the University of California, San Diego, where she conducted her NWO Rubicon research at the Center for Research in Language (CRL) and became a Frontiers of Innovation Scholars Program (FISP) fellow at the departments of Communication and Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Including surveys on Exascale computing and Optimization techniques for GPU programming , both published in ACM Computing Surveys, programming models for highly-optimized distributed GPU applications, including Rocket published at Supercomputing (SC), and Lightning published at International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS). His most successful project is Kernel Tuner , which has featured in tutorials and presentations at world-leading science and industry events including Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference (GTC), ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference (SC), and International Supercomputing (ISC-HPC), and has been used to, among others, enable new scientific methods in localization microscopy, published in Nature Methods and Nature Communications . Teaching Ben van Werkhoven is passionate about teaching and has created two new courses since he started at LIACS. In the Master Computer Science, Ben is teaching his brand new High Performance Computing course. Starting in academic year 2024/2025, he is teaching the new Multiprocessor Programming course, a third year elective course in the Bachelor Computer Science. Active projects Kernel Tuner Main developers: Ben van Werkhoven (creator), Alessio Sclocco, Stijn Heldens, Floris-Jan Willemsen, Willem Jan Palenstijn, Richard Schoonhoven, and Bram Veenboer Kernel Tuner is a software development tool for the creation of highly-optimized and tuned GPU applications. Ben van Werkhoven created Kernel Tuner in 2016, while working on several GPU applications. Recently, the project has grown from a single tool to an ecosystem of tools being built on top of or around Kernel Tuner. Funding: various projects have contributed to the development of Kernel Tuner since 2016. CORTEX The National Science Agenda (NWO NWA) has awarded a 5 million euro grant to CORTEX – the Center for Optimal, Real-Time Machine Studies of the Explosive Universe. The CORTEX consortium of 12 partners from academia, industry and society will make self-learning machines faster, to figure out how massive cosmic explosions work, and to innovate wider applications. Ben van Werkhoven is leading one of the work packages within CORTEX, where he investigates how to create software with the help of machine learning that can make optimal use of the computing power of modern computers. This technology is also applied within the work package to implement the software pipelines for observing explosive events in the universe. As part of CORTEX, we have developed new methods for model-steered auto-tuning to optimize the energy efficiency of several Radio Astronomy applications, click here for the paper . ESiWACE3 The ESiWACE3 project (6 million euro grant funded by EuroHPC JU and national co-funders, including the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO)) aims to advance Europe’s Earth system modeling capabilities. ESiWACE3 has the goal to promote efficient and scalable simulation of weather and climate, to close common technology knowledge gaps and provide toolboxes for high-performance computing for weather and climate modeling in Europe. Ben is leading work package 4 on HPC services, which creates collaborative projects to advance the use new architectures such as GPUs in weather and climate models. As part of work package 2, Ben is also working on extending the capabilities of Kernel Tuner to automatically optimize weather and climate models for high performance, energy efficiency and accuracy. Past projects ConFu The Consolidating and Future-proofing Kernel Tuner by developing Software Engineering Best Practices (ConFu) project (Netherlands eScience Center, 40 K euro) had as its goal to consolidate the Kernel Tuner ecosystem and carry out several software engineering improvements, streamlining the software development processes, and prepare Kernel Tuner for new use cases in future projects and collaborations. The upgrades took place in several software layers and core of Kernel Tuner, as well as in the CI/CD infrastructure. Ben van Werkhoven is the PI of Kernel Tuner, and was the PI for the ConFu project. ESiWACE2 The EU H2020 (8 M euro) funded Centre of Excellence in Simulation of Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE) enables global storm- and eddy resolving weather and climate simulations on the upcoming (pre-)Exascale supercomputers. Ben van Werkhoven was leading the work package on HPC services, which created small collaborative projects that provide guidance, engineering, and advice to developers of weather and climate models. The aim was to improve model efficiency and to port models to new architectures such as GPUs. As part of ESiWACE2, Kernel Tuner was used to optimize and auto-tune several weather and climate simulating codes, including RTE-RRTMGP and MicroHH. eWaterCycle II Ben was co-PI of the eWaterCycle II (Netherlands eScience Center 1.3 M euro) project. The goal of eWaterCycle II was to develop a framework in which hydrological modellers can work together in a collaborative environment. This environment allows to easily combine models and data independent of programming languages, compare models to other models of the same area, and reproduce the results obtained by their peers.",
